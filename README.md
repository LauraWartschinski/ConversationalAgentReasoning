# ConversationalAgentReasoning
A Conversational Agent for the Improvement of Human Reasoning Skills

This is the project I did for my bachelor thesis in 2015/16 - A conversational agent (aka Chatbot) named "Liza" who talks to people in an attempt to teach them Rationality. Rationality in this case is defined by the absence of irrationial choices, in the form of some well-studied reasoning problems.

The Bot explains different topics and asks example questions, provides helpfuls hints and example solutions, and gives feedback. It reacts to user absence and a broad variety of different user-initiated dialogue, it assesses the confidence of the user as well as the correctness of the solutions, and gives further tips for improvement.

The persona of the (purely textual) agent is that of a "young", newly created computer program who is eager to be a good teacher, but is not completely perfected yet. Reasons for this personality choice are also described in detail in the thesis, as well as the architecture, experimental setup, evaluation etc.

More information about the general concept of reasoning and rationality can be found in the PDF version of my thesis.

The Java project is not exactly prepared for the general public, and some of the code is inelegant and not efficient. It is not very well documented, but I would rather move on with new projects than maintain the old projects I.

I will just include some impressions. The snippets are taken from different parts of the conversation and do not come from the same teaching session, and are not neccessarily in that order. They just stand for themselves.
