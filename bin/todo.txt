- Wait for answer, then continue after timeout
- Ask: "Do you want to know how this is done?"
- parse also "3 out of 10" or "7 in hundred" correctly
- say something about the saved information
- save more information about the person, give more intricated intros
- use name more often

- do you want me to give you a hint - more options
- same with "you seem to have problems"
- are you still there - yes
- give me a hint
- ask for percent

- be a bit more socratic!	(How do you know this is the cause?) (Is there anything you can do to proove this?)
- todo Länger warten, besonders bei Fragen, welche Rechnungen erfordern
- Toleranzbereiche abhängig von Art der Antwort bei ParseStatistics
- in percent
- you seem to (zu häufig in der Auswertung)
-
