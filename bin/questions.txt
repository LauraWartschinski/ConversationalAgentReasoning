//1;After the first two weeks of a major league baseball season, newspapers begin to print the top 10 batting averages. Typically, the best player has a huge advantage (his average versus the average of the second best) at that point. However, at the end of the season, the difference in averages is never that high.;Why do you think this is?;What could be the reasons that at the end of the season, no player is leading in averages as far as at the beginning of the season?;baseball;chance,luck,few times,representative,random;memory,remember;no;null;;;;I think you have a very good understanding of the underlying causes. Well done!;I propose a different solution. It's more about statistics than about baseball.;The sample size at the beginning of the season is very small. Just by pure chance, some players will stand out a lot. But at the end of the season, the results are less affected by luck and closer to the true ability of the players, so huge variations don't happen anymore.;Think of the first few games as random picks from the set of performances of the players. What does your statistical knowledge tell you?;//
